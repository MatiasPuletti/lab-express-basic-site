      Vitaly Dmitriyevich "Vitalik" Buterin (Russian: Виталий Дмитриевич
      Бутерин; born January 31, 1994) is a Russian-Canadian programmer and
      writer. He is best known as a co-founder of Ethereum and as a co-founder
      of Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin was born in Kolomna, Moscow Oblast, Russia,
      to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist,[4] and Natalia Ameline (née
      Chistyakova). He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents
      emigrated to Canada in search of better employment opportunities.[5] While
      in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a
      class for gifted children[6] and started to understand that he was drawn
      to math, programming, and economics.
